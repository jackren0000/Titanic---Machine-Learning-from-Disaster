# [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)
## Kaggle Competition Overview

Enefit's challenge is to predict prosumer energy patterns to minimize imbalance costs. For details, visit [Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-energy-behavior-of-prosumers).

The goal is to align expected energy usage with actual consumption to reduce costs associated with energy imbalances.

## Competition Description

Using machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.


## Evaluation

The score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict (accuracy).


## Submitting

You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.
The file should have exactly 2 columns:

PassengerId (sorted in any order)
Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)
